# Fire-Detection-and-notification-using-CNN-MobileNet-and-OpenCV

**Abstract:**

When a fire occurs, it seriously threatens people’s lives and causes major economic losses. Fires continue to occur in modern architecture, the people's lives and property have brought huge losses. In order to reduce the fire in the building automatic camera based fire alarm equipment was placed into a necessity.

Therefore, fire detection is vitally important to protecting people’s lives and property.fire detection is vitally important to protecting people’s lives and property. Therefore, early fire detection and alarm with high sensitivity and accuracy is essential to reduce fire losses. However, traditional fire detection technologies, like smoke and heat detectors, are not suitable for large spaces, complex buildings, or spaces with many disturbances.

To prevent fires and hinder their rapid growth, it is necessary to establish a monitoring system that can detect early fires. Establishing a camera-based automatic fire monitoring algorithm can achieve 24/7 automatic monitoring without interruption, which greatly reduces labor costs.

Important methods,modules and softwares used : CNN,  mobileNetV2, HSV, openCV, mail automation, whatsapp automation.
